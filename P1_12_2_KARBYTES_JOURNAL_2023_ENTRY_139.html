<p>Today I went to the Starbucks near where I work next to Pacific Commons in South Fremont. (Before that I went on a walk to the end of Automall Parkway and then left onto a large open marshland with some salt gathering on the edge of shallow pools of Bay water. There were Canadian geese and other birds sitting on the surface of those shallow waters. There were sand piper birds making high-pitched peeps while foraging in even shallower waters). I attempted to download a meditation music video which I <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on my social media profiles (Twitter and Minds)</a> using the Starbucks Wi-Fi. It was a slow download compared to the download of that meditation music video file  (.mp4) I made using my own AT&amp;T mobile Internet connection (using USB-C tethering between HP laptop and Android phone). Towards the end of the download using the Starbucks Wi-Fi, the process failed. When I attempted to resume it, the file download progress was set back to zero. I left the Starbucks &#8220;third place&#8221; prison of anthropocentrism and found a place more conducive to being a dragon instead of a human. I decided to upload that video file to my corner of the Internet Archive. The hyperlink to that public domain web resource is available below.</p>
