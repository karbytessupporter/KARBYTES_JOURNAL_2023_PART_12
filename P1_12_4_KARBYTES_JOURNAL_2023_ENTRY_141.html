<p>Today I ordered two portable <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AC</a> power banks (which I refer to as &#8220;camping batteries&#8221;) which I have bought (same brand, model, and seller) and used in the past (but I lost both of the two &#8220;camping batteries&#8221; (which feature an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LCD</a> screen displaying the percentage of battery life remaining) and have been living without any &#8220;camping batteries&#8221; for approximately half a year). My (~$400) Hewlett-Packard laptop computer has a battery life of approximately 2 cumulative hours when fully charged. Each of those &#8220;camping batteries&#8221; (~$100 each) also has a battery life of approximately 2 cumulative hours and can be used to extend the battery life of my laptop, (~$80) phone, and other electronic devices (which means that I will be able to use my laptop for a total of approximately 10 cumulative hours between charging sessions if I drain each of those batteries completely after each of them are charged to full capacity in one session (and I have a surge protector which plugs into exactly one AC outlet and which has six separate AC outlets on it which I can plug multiple devices into simultaneously so that their batteries can charge simultaneously)). I ordered those two camping batteries from Amazon dot Com today and set them to be delivered to an Amazon locker at the Lucky&#8217;s grocery store in Castro Valley, California. <span style="background:#ffff00">My purpose for ordering those two &#8220;camping batteries&#8221; is to maximize my range of options for where I can use my laptop computer and to minimize how long and often I have to &#8220;camp&#8221; at a wall outlet in <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;third place&#8221;</a> areas such as Starbucks and BART stations.</span> Not having to make as many trips to the charging stations as often means that I get more &#8220;quality time&#8221; alone with my computers.</p>
