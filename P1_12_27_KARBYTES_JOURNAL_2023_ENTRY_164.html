<p>I shared the following Singularity Hub news article on my Twitter and Minds social media timelines. (I also worked on <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00">triangle_graphing.js</strong> in a nice secluded cement &#8220;cave&#8221; with cement picnic tables and fluorescent lights in it which is located within a quarter mile of the warehouse I work at). It is a beautiful day despite the rain earlier. The temperature is not as cold as it was a few nights ago. In fact, it feels a bit muggy and spring-like; humid. Today is a good day to go to the marsh for a stroll.</p>
